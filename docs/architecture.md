# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The HamtapayGoldPriceInquiry system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Services

1. **Gateway Service** (`apps/gateway`)

    - Main entry point for all client requests
    - Handles routing and request transformation
    - Implements API documentation
    - Manages authentication and authorization

2. **Auth Service** (`apps/auth`)

    - User authentication and authorization
    - JWT token management
    - Role-based access control

3. **Market Data Service** (`apps/market-data`)

    - Real-time gold price updates

4. **Order Service** (`apps/order`)

    - Order management
    - Order status tracking
    - Order history
    - Stock management

5. **Pricing Service** (`apps/pricing`)

    - Price calculations
    - Fee management
    - Discount handling
    - Price rules engine

6. **Notification Service** (`apps/notification`)
    - Email notifications
    - SMS notifications
    - Push notifications
    - Notification preferences

### Communication

-   Inter-service communication using gRPC
-   Message queuing for asynchronous operations
-   REST APIs for external clients

### Data Storage

-   PostgreSQL for relational data
-   Redis for caching
-   MongoDB for market data

### Infrastructure

-   Docker containers for each service
-   Docker Compose for local development
-   Kubernetes for production deployment

## Development Workflow

1. Local Development

    - Each service can be developed independently
    - Docker Compose for local service orchestration
    - Hot reload for rapid development

2. Testing

    - Unit tests for each service
    - Integration tests for service communication
    - E2E tests for complete workflows

3. Deployment
    - CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
    - Blue-green deployment strategy
    - Automated rollback capability

## Security

-   JWT-based authentication
-   Role-based access control
-   API rate limiting
-   Input validation
-   Data encryption

## Monitoring

-   Service health checks
-   Performance metrics
-   Error tracking
-   Usage analytics

## Future Improvements

-   Implement service mesh
-   Add distributed tracing
-   Enhance monitoring capabilities
-   Improve caching strategy
-   Implement circuit breakers
